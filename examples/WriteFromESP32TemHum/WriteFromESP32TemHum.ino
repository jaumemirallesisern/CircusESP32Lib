/*
  WriteFromESP32.ino

  This example code that shows how to feed a signal using the circusofthings.com API through its CircusESP32Lib-1.0.0 library for Arduino IDE.

  With this code you can feed a signal taking the values read from a temperature sensor. 
  
  In this case, we assume we have a DHT11 sensor that is controlled by a propietary protocol implemented in its specific library.

  There are no 3rd part libraries to use, beside DHT Sensor Library Built in by Adafruit Version 1.3.0
